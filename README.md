## **👋 Hi, I’m Kashish! (he/him)**

📚 I’m currently a Computer Science student at the University of British Columbia, pursuing my second degree after earning a [B.Sc](http://b.sc/) in Biology. I’m eager to apply my interdisciplinary insights and technical skills to help create innovative solutions and make a positive impact. Outside of academia, I’m passionate about building communities by organizing hackathons, community service initiatives, and social events!
